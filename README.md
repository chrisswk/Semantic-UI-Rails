# Semantic-UI-Rails
If you want to try Semantic-UI with Rails you've come to the right place.

Semantic-UI is an HTML-CSS-Javascript user interface toolkit. Though Semantic-UI has lots of documentation, there is no tutorial, so it took me a while to wrap my head around and make it play nice with Rails.  I hope to save you that trouble.

1. This README describes how to add Semantic-UI to a new or existing Rails app.  

2. This repo also contains a new Rails 4.2.3 app with the correct Gems and Semantic-UI already set up.  See "Using the Basic Semantic-UI Rails App".

3. A larger Repo, -- *Semantic-UI-Rails-User-Session* -contains a Rails 4.2.3 app in which I prebuilt *User* and *Session* resources.  It has_secure_password authentication, user sign up, user login, and session management and uses Semantic-UI to provide the web interface for those features.  The user signup page uses Semantic-UI's amazing client-side validation support to This gives you a few examples of how to connect Rails RESTful resources to Semantic-UI.

There are no resources but there are routes, a semantic-ui controller, and several html.erb files paired with similarly named javascript files as needed to make them run.  You can cut/paste and deconstruct and soon you'll get the hang of it.
