# Semantic-UI-Rails
####[Semantic-UI](www.semantic-ui.com) is one of the newest and most promising user interface toolkits.  
```
It's beautiful, mobile responsive, and provides complex UI widgets gracefully.  
Theming support enables sites to have their own visually unique, yet consistent look and feel.
```

1. This **README** describes how to add Semantic-UI to a new or existing Rails app.  
2. This **repo** contains a new Rails 4.2.3 app with Semantic-UI already set up and several examples integrated into routes, controller, helper, layout and views.  You can fork this repo and be running immediately.  

You need to know HTML-CSS-Javascript and JQuery to use Semantic-UI.  Semantic-UI itself is a set of CSS/LESS, Javascript/JQuery libraries that you include (and sometimes modify) in your project.  You make use of Semantic-UI by writing special (and quite elegant) HTML classes and calling appropriate Javascript/JQuery routines.  

Lawrence Turton has a non-rails [tutorial](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/getting-started-with-semantic-ui) over at Tuts.

There are many features of Semantic-UI I haven't tried yet.  If you try them before I do, send me an email or pull request.
