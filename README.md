# Semantic-UI-Rails
####[Semantic-UI](www.semantic-ui.com) is one of the newest and most promising user interface toolkits.  
```
It's beautiful, mobile responsive, and provides complex UI widgets gracefully.  
Theming support enables sites to have their own visually unique, yet consistent look and feel.
```

1. This **README** describes how to add Semantic-UI to a new or existing Rails app.  
2. This **repo** contains a new Rails 4.2.3 app with Semantic-UI already set up and several examples integrated into routes, controller, helper, layout and views.  You can fork this repo and be running immediately.  

Semantic-UI is a library written in HTML-CSS-Javascript and JQuery and you need to know these.  

3. It is my intention to next build a larger Repo, **Semantic-UI-Rails-User-Session** that will contain a Rails 4.2.3 app in which I've prebuilt *User* and *Session* resources.  It will provide secure_password authentication, user sign up, user login, and session management, ideally adding oauth for GitHub, LinkedIn and Google.  It will use Semantic-UI to provide the web interface for those features it's amazing support for validation.  It would be my starting point project from now on. I hope to add several OAuth examples to it to round it out.

There are many features of Semantic-UI I haven't tried yet.  If you try them before I do, send me an email or pull request.
