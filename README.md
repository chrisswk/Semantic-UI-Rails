# Semantic-UI-Rails
####[Semantic-UI](www.semantic-ui.com) is one of the newest and most promising user interface toolkits.  
```
It's beautiful, mobile responsive, and provides complex UI widgets gracefully.  
Theming support enables sites to have their own visually unique, yet consistent look and feel.
```

Just as it's said there is a *Rails Way* of doing things, there is also a *Semantic-UI* way.  I think you'll like it.  Depending on your level of experience, though, it can take a little time to wrap your head around it and figure out how to make it play nice with Rails.  It did for me and so I wrote this.  Once you are up and running, you'll find the Semantic-UI website has lots of documentation.   

1. This **README** describes how to add Semantic-UI to a new or existing Rails app.  
2. This **repo** contains a new Rails 4.2.3 app with Semantic-UI already set up, and integrated into several examples structured for Rails.  See "Using the Basic Semantic-UI Rails App".

Semantic-UI is a library written in HTML-CSS-Javascript and JQuery and you need to know these.  

3. A larger Repo, **Semantic-UI-Rails-User-Session** contains a Rails 4.2.3 app in which I've prebuilt *User* and *Session* resources.  It has_secure_password authentication, user sign up, user login, and session management and uses Semantic-UI to provide the web interface for those features.  The user signup form uses Semantic-UI's amazing client-side support for  validation.  This would take you a long time to build by hand.  This repo gives you a few examples of how get Rails RESTful resources talking to Semantic-UI.  I built it with the idea that it would be my starting point project from now on. I hope to add several OAuth examples to it round it out.

There are many features of Semantic-UI I haven't tried yet.  If you try them before I do, send me an email or pull request.
