# Semantic-UI-Rails
If you want to try Semantic-UI with Rails you've come to the right place.  

![Semantic UI screenshot] (https://github.com/iMikie/Semantic-UI-Rails/blob/master/SUI_screenshot.png)

Semantic-UI is an HTML-CSS-Javascript-JQuery **user interface toolkit*. Though Semantic-UI has lots of documentation, there is no tutorial yet so depending on your level of experience, it may take a while to wrap your head around it and make it play nice with Rails.  I hope to save you that trouble.

1. This README describes how to add Semantic-UI to a new or existing Rails app.  

2. This repo also contains a new Rails 4.2.3 app with the correct Gems and Semantic-UI paths, includes and configs already set up.  It also contains several examples structured for Rails.  See "Using the Basic Semantic-UI Rails App".

3. A larger Repo, -- *Semantic-UI-Rails-User-Session* -contains a Rails 4.2.3 app in which I prebuilt *User* and *Session* resources.  It has_secure_password authentication, user sign up, user login, and session management and uses Semantic-UI to provide the web interface for those features.  The user signup page uses Semantic-UI's amazing client-side validation support.  This would take you a long time to build by hand.  It serves to give you a few examples of how to display Rails RESTful resources in Semantic-UI.  I built it with the idea that it would be my starting point project from now on. I hope to add several OAuth examples to it round it out.

* There are many features of Semantic-UI I haven't tried yet.  If you try them before I do, please let me know and/or send me a pull request.
