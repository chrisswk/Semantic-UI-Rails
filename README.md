# Semantic-UI-Rails

If want to try Semantic-UI with Rails you've come to the right place.  If you are not sure what Semantic-UI is, see the next sections. Though Semantic-UI has lots of documentation, there is no tutorial, so it took me a while to wrap my head around and get running with Rails.  I hope to save you that trouble and make the "hump" that much easier to get over.

* If you want to start with a Rails 4.2.3 app that has Semantic-UI already set up, fork this repository.  There are Semantic-UI examples which I modified as needed to run on Rails that you can deconstruct and soon you'll get the hang of it. 
* You can also start from a larger repo -- *Semantic-UI-Rails-User-Session* -- a Rails 4.2.3 app in which I prebuilt *User* and *Session* resources.  It has_secure_password authentication, user sign up, user login, and session management and uses Semantic-UI to provide the web interface for those features.  The user signup page uses Semantic-UI's amazing client-side validation support to This gives you a few examples of how to connect Rails RESTful resources to Semantic-UI.
* This README describes how to add Semantic-UI to your existing Rails app.  There are many features of Semantic-UI I haven't tried yet.  If you try them before I do, please let me know and/or send me a pull request.
